What-is-a-living-wage?:Comparing an hourly wage to the 28/36 Rule
=================================================================

Final Capstone Project for Nashville Software School Data Analytics Part-time Cohort 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# MOTIVATION #
Reports and social media discussions have been circulating for the last few years regarding the rising national 
cost of living despite salaries and wages remaining stagnant. I wanted to take a closer look at how drastic or 
not these compare using Nashville, TN as a starting reference point.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY #
My capstone project is a comparison of wages to the cost of living from 2010 to the year 2020. Over the last 10 years we as Americans have seen numerous reports, political debate and social media posts stating we need a minimum/living wage of at least $15.00 per hour. Americans are often depicted as living and working in the “rat race”, working 40+ hours a week to only scrape by paycheck to paycheck. I hope to breakdown an approximate wage/salary to live comfortably in Nashville and/or areas comparable. My current assumption based on past articles is one must make at least $70-80k yearly to live “comfortably” in Nashville, TN, well over the $15.00 minimum suggested.

# 28/36 RULE #
The 28% rule states a household should spend 28% of the gross income on housing. The 36% of the gross income is spent on the remaining debt including not limited to car loans, credit cards etc.
[Article reference](The 28/36 Rule: What Is It, and How Does It Affect Your Mortgage?)

# DATA QUESTION #
How much should one individual bring home gross to cover housing using the 28/36 rule?

# MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT #
My final analysis will include charts and an interactive dashboard to illustrate how much a person would need to bring home gross to afford housing in Nashville, TN.  My hopes would be for this project to be presented to senior leaders of area organizations as well as members of state governments,  the House,  and Congress. Here, some decisions and compromises can be made around what the future of Tennessee, as well as America, looks like so we can all live comfortably.
